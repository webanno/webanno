[[sect_installation]]
== Installation

=== Run as Java application

All-in-one version which does not require a database server or servlet container to be set up.

[NOTE]
====
By default, WebAnno creates and uses an embedded database. It is not recommended to use WebAnno in
such a configuration for production use. Instead, please configure WebAnno to use a database server
when using it in production. For more information, please refer to the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_database,Administrator Guide>>.
====

Get the standalone jar from the [WebAnnoInstFile downloads] and start it simply with a *double-click* in your file manager. WebAnno stores its data in a folder called `.webanno` (_dot webanno_) within your home folder,

You can start with the [SampleProjects example projects] to explore some of the functionalities. 

[NOTE]
====
If you have previously used an older version of the WebAnno standalone, make sure to clean up the temporary installation before running the new version:

   * On OS X: `rm -R "$TMPDIR/winstoneEmbeddedWAR"`
   * On Linux: `rm -R /tmp/winstoneEmbeddedWAR`
   * On Windows: remove the `winstoneEmbeddedWAR` that should be somewhere under `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp`
====

==== Optional configuration

Alternatively, you can start WebAnno from the command line, in particular if you wish to provide it with additional memory (here 1 GB) or if you want it to store its data in a different folder.

----
java -Xmx1g -Dwebanno.home=/my/webanno/home -jar webanno-XXX-standalone.jar
----

Mind to replace `/my/webanno/home` with path of a folder where WebAnno can store its data.

By default the server starts on port 8080 and you can access it via a browser at `http://localhost:8080` after you started it. You can add the parameter `--httpPort=9999` at the end of the command line to start the server on port 9999 (or choose any other port).

A full list of the command line parameters can be found in the link:http://winstone.sourceforge.net/#commandLine[Winstone documentation].

=== Run using Docker

==== Quick start

If you have Docker installed, you can run WebAnno using

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker run -it --name webanno -p8080:18080 webanno/webanno:{revnumber}
----

The command download WebAnno from Dockerhub and starts it on port 8080. If this port is not
available on your machine, you should provide another port to the `-p` parameter. 

The logs will be printed to the console. To stop the container, press `CTRL-C`.

NOTE: Use `docker run` only the first time that you run WebAnno. If you try it a second time, Docker
      will complain about the name `webanno` already being in use. If you follow Docker`s suggestion
      to delete the container, you will loose all your WebAnno data. Further below, we explain how
      you can store your data outside the container in a folder on your host.
      
When you want to run WebAnno again later, use the command

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker start -ai webanno
----

Again, the logs will be printed to the console. To stop the container, press `CTRL-C`.

==== Storing data on the host

If you follow the quick start instructions above, WebAnno will store all its data inside the docker
container. This is normally not what you want because as soon as you delete the container, all data
is gone. That means for example that you cannot easily upgrade to a new version of the WebAnno
docker image when one is released.

To store your data on your host computer, first create a folder where you want to store your data.
For example, if you are on Linux, you could create a folder `/srv/webanno`:

----
$ mkdir /srv/webanno
----

When you run WebAnno via Docker, you then mount this folder into the container:

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker run -it --name webanno -v /srv/webanno:/export -p8080:18080 webanno/webanno:{revnumber}
----

==== Connecting to a MySQL database

By default, WebAnno uses an embedded SQL database to store its metadata (not the texts and 
annotations, these are stored in files on disk). For production use, it is highly recommended to
use a separate MySQL database instead of the embedded SQL database.

To configure WebAnno to use a separate database, place a file called `settings.properties` into the
data folder that you mount into the WebAnno container. It should contain the following contents:

----
database.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
database.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/webanno
database.username=webanno
database.password=t0t4llYSecreT
----

NOTE: The settings are just examples. Adjust the database URL, username, and password according to
      your MySQL setup.
