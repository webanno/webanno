=== Installation guide to develop WebAnno in Eclipse

This is a guide to setting up a developer environment in Eclipse for WebAnno using Max OS X. The 
procedure should be similar for other operation systems.  

First, you need to follow some steps of the user [InstallationGuide installation guide]. You need to
configure your MySQL-server for WebAnno. After that, jump right to the chapter WebAnno and follow
all steps besides the first one until the end of the document.

We recommend you start from a Eclipse Classic distribution.

=== Eclipse plugins

* *Maven Integration:* m2e , already comes pre-installed with the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.
  If you use another edition of Eclipse which does not have m2e pre-installed, go to *Help->Install
  New Software, select "--All available sites--" and choose Collaboration -> m2e - Maven Integration
  for Eclipse*

* *Apache UIMA tools:* Update site: `http://www.apache.org/dist/uima/eclipse-update-site/`

* You should check that Text file encoding is UTF-8  in *Preferences -> General -> Workspace* of 
  your Eclipse install.

=== WebAnno and Tomcat installation

Checkout out the WebAnno git repository with your favorite git client. If you use the command-line
client, use the command

[source,text]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/webanno/webanno.git
----

In Eclipse, go to *File -> Import*, choose *Existing Maven projects*, and select the folder to which
you have cloned WebAnno. Eclipse should automatically detect all modules.

Download Apache Tomcat from `http://tomcat.apache.org/` (we're using version 7). Then, you need to
add the Tomcat server to your runtime configuration. Go to preferences and go to *Servers -> Runtime environments*:

// http://webanno.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/AddApacheTomcat.png

When prompted for an installation path, specify the folder where you extracted (or installed) Apache
Tomcat v7 into. 

Change the runtime configuration for the project. On the left side of the dialog, you should now be
able to select Apache Tomcat. Change its VM arguments and include the definition 
`-Dwebanno.home="/srv/webanno"` to specify the home directory for WebAnno. Also add `-Dwicket.configuration=development` to enable the development mode for WebAnno. This adds additional
debugging features to the UI and disables UI caches.

// http://webanno.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/ChangeRunConfiguration.png

Head to the servers pane. If you cannot locate it in your eclipse window, add it by going to
*Window -> Show View -> Other...* and select *Servers*. Right click on *Tomcat v7 localhost* and
click on *Add and remove...*:

// http://webanno.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/AddAndRemoveServer.png

// You should end up with:

// http://webanno.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/AddAndRemoveServerFinal.png

WebAnno should now be configured to start with tomcat.

In the *Servers* view, double-click on the Tomcat instance you have configured. Activate the checkbox *Serve modules without publishing*. Go to the *Modules* tab, select the WebAnno module and disable
auto-reloading. After these changes, you will have to manually restart the Tomcat server in order
for changes to Java class files to take effect. However, as a benefit, changes to HTML, CSS or
JavaScript files take effect immediately and you just have to refresh the browser to see the changes.

=== Checkstyle

* Install Checkstyle Eclipse plugin from here: http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net
* Go to Eclipse Preferences
** Go to Checkstyle pane
** Add new *Global Check Configuration*
** Select Type *Project relative*
** Go to the project*webanno-build*
** Enter the name *WebAnno checkstyle file*
** Select file *src/main/resources/webanno/checkstyle.xml*
* Configure one WebAnno module as a blueprint
** Right-click on top-level WebAnno project
** Select *Properties* from the popup
** Go to *Checkstyle* pane
** Select *WebAnno checkstyle file*
** Apply and close
* Apply blueprint to the other WebAnno modules
** Select all WebAnno projects except the top-level project in the package explorer
** Right-click on the selected projects
** Select *Checkstyle->Configure project(s) from blueprint*
** In the popup, select top-level WebAnno project
** Apply and close
* Enable Checkstyle for all WebAnno modules
** Select all WebAnno projects in the package explorer
** Right-click on the selected projects
** Select *Checkstyle->Activate checkstyle*

=== Troubleshooting

If you run into problems with the last step (Add and remove...) and get the error 'There are no
resources that can be added or removed from the server', checkout if you have installed 
_m2eclipse-wtp_:

http://webanno.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Problems%20with%20no%20resource%20available.png

and go to the project settings and check if these project facets are activated for the project. 
If you have the _ m2eclipse-wtp_ installed, it should be sufficient to right-click on the project 
and do a  *Maven -> Update project* to reconfigure the project and have m2e update these settings:
