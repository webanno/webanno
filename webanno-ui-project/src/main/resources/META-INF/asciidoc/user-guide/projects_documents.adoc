Open the upload dialog by on *Choose Files*. If you browser supports uploading multiple documents, you can usually either select a range of files or multiple files individually. To select a range, click on the fist document, press *SHIFT* and then clicking on the last document in the desired range. To (de)select individual files, press *CTRL* and then the file you want to (de)select.

Select the *Format* corresponding to the documents you upload. If you are uploading multiple documents at once, the all must have the same format.

Then click on *Import Document*. 
The imported documents can be seen in the list below.
To delete a document from the project, you have to click on it and then click on *Delete* in the right lower corner.

.Uploading large numbers of documents
While it is possible to upload multiple documents at once, there are limits to how many documents can be uploaded in a single upload operation. For a start, it can take quite some time to upload thousands of documents. Also, the server configuration limits the individual file size and total batch size (the default limit is 100MB for both). Finally, browsers differ in their capability of dealing with large numbers of documents in an upload. In a test with 5000 documents of each ca. 2.5kb size including Chrome, Safari and Firebird, only Chrome (80.0.3987.122) completed the operation successfully. Safari (13.0.5) was only able to do upload about 3400 documents. Firebird (73.0.1) froze during the upload and was unable to deliver anything to the server. With a lower number of documents (e.g. 500), none of the browsers had any problems.
