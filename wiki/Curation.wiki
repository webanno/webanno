#summary Describes the curation functionality of WebAnno

== Curation ==
When navigating to the *Curation Page*, the procedure for opening projects and documents is the same as in [https://code.google.com/p/webanno/wiki/Annotation Annotation].  The *Page* navigation is also equivalent to [https://code.google.com/p/webanno/wiki/Annotation Annotation].

In the left frame of the window, named *Sentences*, the sentences of the chosen document are displayed. The ones shaded in red created a conflict in annotation.

If you want to see the annotations that were made in a sentence, you have to click on the sentence. Then on the right side of the window, the annotations are displayed.

The frame called *Merged* shows the result of the default merge the conflicting annotations. Below, the annotated sentences are shown in separate frames, entitled with the annotators logins. By double-clicking on the annotation of an annotator's frame, you select his annotation to in the merged sentence. The sentence in the merged frame can be treated like a sentence in the *Annotation*. By selecting a word with a click you are able to produce new annotations, by clicking on an annotation, you are able to change its classification or delete it.
The different states of the annotation agreement are marked by different colours. If the annotations were the same, they are marked grey in the lower frames and light blue in the merged frame. If the annotations are disparate, the markings are dark blue in the lower frames. By default, they are not taken into the merged file. If you choose one annotation to be right by clicking on it, the chosen annotation will turn green in the frame of the corresponding annotator. Also, the annotation will say *USE* next to the classification. 
The annotations which were not chosen to be in the merged file are marked dark blue. The annotations which were wrongly classified are marked in red.

I don't get why sometimes there is an AGREE and sometimes not
