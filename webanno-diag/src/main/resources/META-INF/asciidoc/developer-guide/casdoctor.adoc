== CAS Doctor

The CAS Doctor is an essential development tool. When enabled, it checks the CAS for
consistency when loading or saving a CAS. It can also automatically repair inconsistencies when
configured to do so. This section gives an overview of the available checks and repairs.

It is safe to enable any <<sect_checks,checks>>. However, active checks may considerably slow down 
the application, in particular for large documents or for actions that work with many documents, e.g. 
curation or the calculation of agreement. Thus, checks should not be enabled on a production system
unless the application behaves strangely and it is necessary to check the documents for consistency.

Enabling <<sect_repairs,repairs>> should be done with great care as most repairs are performing
destructive actions. Repairs should never be enabled on a production system. The repairs are
executed in the order in which they are appear in the `debug.casDoctor.repairs` setting. This is
important in particular when applying destructive repairs.

When documents are loaded, CAS Doctor first tries to apply any enabled <<sect_repairs,repairs>>
and afterwards applies enabled <<sect_checks,checks>> to ensure that the potentially repaired
document is consistent.

Additionally, CAS Doctor applies enabled <<sect_checks,checks>> *before* saving a document. This
ensures that a bug in the user interface introduces inconsistencies into the document on disk. I.e.
the consistency of the persisted document is protected! Of course, it requires that relevant checks
have been implemented and are actually enabled.

By default, CAS Doctor generates an exception when a check or repair fails. This ensures that
inconsistencies are contained and do not propagate further. In some cases, e.g. when it is known
that by its nature an inconsistency does not propagate and can be avoided by the user, it may be
convenient to allow the user to continue working with the application while a repair is being developed.
In such a case, CAS Doctor can be configured to be non-fatal. Mind that users can always continue
to work on documents that are consistent. CAS Doctor only prevents loading inconsistent documents
and saving inconsistent documents.

[[sect_checks]]
=== Checks

[[check_AllFeatureStructuresIndexedCheck]]
==== All Feature Structures Indexed

[horizontal]
ID:: `AllFeatureStructuresIndexedCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_RemoveDanglingChainLinksRepair>>, <<repair_RemoveDanglingRelationsRepair>>, <<repair_ReindexFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair>>

This check verifies if all reachable feature structures in the CAS are also indexed. We do not
currently use any un-indexed feature structures. If there are any un-indexed feature structures in the
CAS, it is likely due to a bug in the application and can cause undefined behavior.

For example, older versions of {product-name} had a bug that caused deleted spans still to be
accessible through relations which had used the span as a source or target.

This check is very extensive and slow. 

[[check_FeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsTrulyAttachedCheck]]
==== Feature-Attached Span Annotations Truly Attached

[horizontal]
ID:: `FeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsTrulyAttachedCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_ReattachFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair>>, <<repair_ReattachFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsAndDeleteExtrasRepair>>

Certain span layers are attached to another span layer through a feature reference
from that second layer. For example, annotations in the POS layer must always be referenced from
a Token annotation via the Token feature `pos`. This check ensures that annotations on layers such
as the POS layer are properly referenced from the attaching layer (e.g. the Token layer).

[[check_LinksReachableThroughChainsCheck]]
==== Links Reachable Through Chains

[horizontal]
ID:: `LinksReachableThroughChainsCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_RemoveDanglingChainLinksRepair>>

Each chain in a chain layers consist of a *chain* and several *links*. The chain
points to the first link and each link points to the following link. If the CAS contains any links
that are not reachable through a chain, then this is likely due to a bug.

[[check_NoMultipleIncomingRelationsCheck]]
==== No Multiple Incoming Relations

[horizontal]
ID:: `NoMultipleIncomingRelationsCheck`

Check that nodes have only one in-going dependency relation inside the same annotation layer.
Since dependency relations form a tree, every node of this tree can only have at most one parent node.
This check outputs a message that includes the sentence number (useful to jump directly to the problem) and the actual offending dependency edges.

[[check_NoZeroSizeTokensAndSentencesCheck]]
==== No Zero-Size Tokens and Sentences

[horizontal]
ID:: `NoZeroSizeTokensAndSentencesCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_RemoveZeroSizeTokensAndSentencesRepair>>

Zero-sized tokens and sentences are not valid and can cause undefined behavior.

[[check_RelationOffsetsCheck]]
==== Relation Offsets Check

[horizontal]
ID:: `RelationOffsetsCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_RelationOffsetsRepair>>

Checks that the offsets of relations match the target of the relation. This mirrors the DKPro
Core convention that the offsets of a dependency relation must match the offsets of the 
dependent.

[[sect_repairs]]
=== Repairs

[[repair_ReattachFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair]]
==== Re-attach Feature-Attached Span Annotations

[horizontal]
ID:: `ReattachFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair`

This repair action attempts to attach spans that should be attached to another span, but are not.
E.g. it tries to set the `pos` feature of tokens to the POS annotation for that respective token.
The action is not performed if there are multiple stacked annotations to choose from. Stacked
attached annotations would be an indication of a bug because attached layers are not allowed to
stack.

This is a safe repair action as it does not delete anything.


[[repair_ReattachFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsAndDeleteExtrasRepair]]
==== Re-attach Feature-Attached Span Annotations And Delete Extras

[horizontal]
ID:: `ReattachFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsAndDeleteExtrasRepair`

This is a destructive variant of <<repair_ReattachFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair>>. In
addition to re-attaching unattached annotations, it also removes all extra candidates that cannot
be attached. For example, if there are two unattached Lemma annotations at the position of a Token
annotation, then one will be attached and the other will be deleted. Which one is attached and 
which one is deleted is undefined.


[[repair_ReindexFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair]]
==== Re-index Feature-Attached Span Annotations

[horizontal]
ID:: `ReindexFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair`

This repair locates annotations that are reachable via a attach feature but which are not actually
indexed in the CAS. Such annotations are then added back to the CAS indexes.

This is a safe repair action as it does not delete anything.

[[repair_RelationOffsetsRepair]]
==== Repair Relation Offsets

[horizontal]
ID:: `RelationOffsetsRepair`

Fixes that the offsets of relations match the target of the relation. This mirrors the DKPro
Core convention that the offsets of a dependency relation must match the offsets of the 
dependent.

[[repair_RemoveDanglingChainLinksRepair]]
==== Remove Dangling Chain Links

[horizontal]
ID:: `RemoveDanglingChainLinksRepair`

This repair action removes all chain links that are not reachable through a chain.

Although this is a destructive repair action, it is likely a safe action in most cases. Users are
not able see chain links that are not part of a chain in the user interface anyway.

[[repair_RemoveDanglingRelationsRepair]]
==== Remove Dangling Relations

[horizontal]
ID:: `RemoveDanglingRelationsRepair`

This repair action removes all relations that point to unindexed spans. 

Although this is a destructive repair action, it is likely a safe action in most cases. When
deleting a span, normally any attached relations are also deleted (unless there is a bug).
Dangling relations are not visible in the user interface.

[[repair_RemoveZeroSizeTokensAndSentencesRepair]]
==== Remove Zero-Size Tokens and Sentences

[horizontal]
ID:: `RemoveZeroSizeTokensAndSentencesRepair`

This is a destructive repair action and should be used with care. When tokens are removed, also
any attached lemma, POS, or stem annotations are removed. However, no relations that attach to 
lemma, POS, or stem are removed, thus this action could theoretically leave dangling relations
behind. Thus, the <<repair_RemoveDanglingRelationsRepair>> repair action should be configured
*after* this repair action in the settings file.
