= Primitive Features

Supported primitive features types are string, boolean, integer, and float.
Boolean features are displayed as a checkbox that can either be marked or unmarked. Integer and 
float features are displayed using a number field. However if an integer feature is limited and the
difference between the maximum and minimum is lower than 12 it can also be displayed with a radio
button group instead. String features are displayed using a text field
or a text area with multiple rows. If multiple rows are enabled it can either be dynamically sized
or a size for collapsing and expanding can be configured. The multiple rows, non-dynamic text area
can be expanded if focused and collapses again if focus is lost. In case the string feature has a
tagset it will instead use a combobox.
